# news-explorer-backend

This back-end project is being made with the goal of supporting the front-end application News Explorer (https://github.com/Ian-Diz/news-explorer-frontend). This project will add the ability to create a user profile, and save articles to a page where you can refer to them later. I will be doing this using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB, whilst keeping to REST API standards.

## Running the project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
